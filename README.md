# Getting familiar with Rust / Substrate

In order to get more familiar with Rust, the following tasks have been done:

  * Rustlings exercises (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings):
  
    * Most of the exercises from Rustlings have been completed

  * Udemy course:
  
    * Learn Rust by Building Real Applications (https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-fundamentals/)
    
 Then, to be more familiar with Substrate, tutorials on Substrate have been followed (https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/). More in particular,

    * Build a local blockchain
    
    * Add a pallet to the runtime
     
    * Develop smart contracts

    * Unit test
    
    * Debug
     
    * Benchmark

  * Testing smart contracts with the ink playground has also be done (https://ink.substrate.io/). For instance:

    * ERC20
    
    * ERC721
