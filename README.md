# Getting familiar with Rust / Substrate

#### In order to get more familiar with Rust, the following tasks have been done:

  * Rustlings exercises (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings):
  
    * Most of the exercises from Rustlings have been completed

  * Udemy course:
  
    * Learn Rust by Building Real Applications (https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-fundamentals/)
    
  * Studying the book:
  
    * https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
    
#### Then, to be more familiar with Substrate, tutorials on Substrate have been followed (https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/). More in particular,

  * Build a local blockchain
  
  	* A screenshot can be found in the repository to show the node is up
    
  * Add a pallet to the runtime

    * Nicks pallet: Allows blockchain users to pay a deposit to reserve a nickname for an account they control

    * As shown in the tutorial, to add the Nicks pallet, the files Cargo.toml and src/lib.rs of the Runtime folder shall be modified. These can be found in the repository
     
  * Develop smart contracts
  
  * Tests:

      * Unit test
    
      * Debug
     
      * Benchmark
      
      	  * Use of the Criterion library

Smart contracts testing with the ink playground has also been done (https://ink.substrate.io/). For instance:

  * ERC20
    
  * ERC721
